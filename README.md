# Online Evasion for Sierpinski Curve
This repository contains code of the work done by me under Prof. Arpita Sinha, IIT Bombay. This repo specifically stores the preliminary work, The algortihm and the approach to the problem has changed over time. New details, codes and report will be push soon.
1. Sierpinski-paper1.pdf : Details of basic Algorithm, whose implmentation given in 3.
2. Coverage Planning (CP) using Sierpinski-Knoop curve (SKc).pdf : Contains details of algorithm developed subsequently. A good point 
3. complete_code.py : Python code for end-to-end implementation of work given in the 1.
4. curv.py : Python code to generate the sierpinski curve.
5. series.py : Python code required by algorithm. Find details in 1.
